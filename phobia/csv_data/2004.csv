23,February 6,40,122,"Moscow, Russia","February 2004 Moscow Metro bombing: A blast tore apart a metro train car in Moscow during the morning rush hour. The train was traveling between the Paveletskaya station and the Avtozavodskaya station around 8:40 am. The explosion occurred in the second car of the train, blowing out windows and causing metal pieces of the train to be strewn in all directions. The device had an explosive power of about 4–5 kg of TNT. The device was similar to that used in the commuter train attack in Yessentuki in 2003. Those who survived were forced to walk through the dark tunnel to exit the subway. At least forty people were killed and 122 injured. However, the death toll was expected to rise as many bodies had been torn apart during the explosion and were difficult to identify. Police believe that they have surveillance video of two of the perpetrators. The video shows two suspicious looking people boarding the train with briefcases. In addition to these two people, police had also identified one other suspect, also a woman. The main theory of investigators was that the blast was perpetrated by suicide bombers, probably the two women companions of the man caught on video. However, other theories, including the possibility that the bomb was set on time delay and placed in a briefcase, were also being considered. Police had released a photograph of the male suspect. On February 8, the case was transferred to the FSB, as officials felt that they were unlikely to find the suspect in Moscow. Instead, they were hoping to gain information from other regions. Although Russian officials believe that Chechen rebels were behind the attack, particularly terrorists affiliated with Abu al-Walid al-Ghalidi, Chechen leaders deny involvement. Some officials speculated that the attack had occurred in an attempt to disrupt the upcoming March elections. Putin vowed that this would not happen. There was also some speculation that there was a connection between al-Qaida and this incident. On March 1, several sources reported that a previously unknown terrorist group, known as Gazoton-Murdash (a Chechen group), claimed responsibility for the incident. A statement was received first on February 8, and then several times after that. Kavkaz-Tzentr did not publish the letter until it had been received three times along with a phone call. The leader of the group said that the attack was intended to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the killing of Chechen civilians by Russian soldiers who took control of Groznyy. Chechen authorities were unsure if the group was a valid organization and were attempting to ascertain the true identity of the group leader, Lom-Ali Chechensky, and determine if the claim of responsibility is accurate. On March 4, Izvestiya reported that the statement of Lom-Ali was actually a reaction to the reported killing of Ruslan Gelayev in Dagestan. The source stated that this claim of responsibility was only propaganda, used to deflect attention from the killing of Gelayev and as retaliation for Russian propaganda. On September 28, Officials announced that they believed Anzor Izhayev was responsible for the blast. They believe that he died in the attack. The suspicion was based on genetic tests.[1]",Riyadus-Salihiin,Second Chechen War

At least one of these bombs detonated at El Pozo, a small commuter station in Madrid. It is impossible to disaggregate the casualties from any of the blast sites because of poor reporting. The bombs were detonated by cell phones and were left in backpacks.

In their claim of responsibility, the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade says that Spain was targeted because of their cooperation with the US in the war in Iraq. In response to the attacks, the ruling Spanish party was defeated in elections mainly because they lied about those attacks(which took place four days after the incident) and the new Prime Minister vowed to remove Spanish troops from combat in Iraq.

88,May 9,10,56,"Grozny, Russia","2004 Grozny stadium bombing: A bomb exploded in the Dynamo stadium in the Chechen capital, Groznyy, killing the republic's president Akhmad Kadyrov. Kadyrov was elected last fall in what was considered by many to be a fraudulent vote. The explosion was caused by a bomb planted inside a concrete pillar and occurred at 10:35am during a parade and concert in Groznyy celebrating the 59th anniversary of the victory of Germany in World War 2. The blast tore a hole in the section designate for dignitaries. It was not clear if the explosion was specifically targeting Kadyrov or whether it would have occurred regardless of his presence, as he was not officially scheduled to be at this event. Khussein Isayev, chairman of the Republic's state council, and Adlan Khasanov, a reported for Reuters, were also killed in the blast. Col. Gen. Valery Baranov, the commander of the Russian military in the northern Caucasus was gravely wounded. Although estimates of total casualties varied, at least ten people were killed and around fifty more injured. These numbers include many civilians and WW2 veterans who were also attending the celebrations. Officials believe that the blast was detonated by remote control and was intentionally installed below the VIP section. The bomb may have been planted some time ago during the recent renovations to the stadium. Preliminary reports suggest that the bomb was equivalent to one ton of TNT. The location of the bomb made it impossible for existing equipment to detect. The type of explosive appeared identical to the type used to blow up the military parade two years ago in the Dagestani city of Kaspiysk. Rescue workers prevented two other blasts in the stadium. They were able to defuse another landmine and an additional explosive device equipped with a timer set to go off 30 minutes after the first explosion. On May 12, another explosive device was found in the half-ruined Dynamo Stadium. The device consisted of TNT charges and pieces of metal. It was unclear if the device had been planted recently or a long time ago. Rebel leader Shamil Basayev claimed that he was involved in and had organized the blast. The attack may have been intended to sow panic and disorder among the Chechen leadership. Initial investigations were focusing on the security staff at the stadium and the builders who took part in the renovations of the stadium. Investigators believe that insufficient training and organization of the security staff was faulted for allowing the attack to occur. Officials had detained at least five individuals for potential involvement in the attack, including Ibragim Musayev, who was also involved in the hostage-taking raid of the Dubrovka Theatre and the bomb attack near a McDonald's in Moscow. Investigators had also given a more specific list of suspects who were under investigation to the Russian Duma. The Russian appointed Prime Minister, Sergei Abramov will serve as President until new elections are held sometime before September, as stipulated by the republic's constitution. The attack serves a blow to Putin and his strategy for ending the conflict in Chechnya. On August 5, Interfax reported that three suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack, two of whom had already confessed to the crime.
