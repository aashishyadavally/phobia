16,January 16    ,70,170,"Baghdad, Iraq: Three explosive devices, including one detonated by a suicide bomber, killed at least seventy students and injured as many as 170 others at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. The attack occurred as students, the majority women, were leaving campus for the day. The first bomb exploded near the University's entrance and the second close to another exit. The suicide bomber was discovered by guards and detonated his device prematurely, killing himself but wounding only two people. Attacks on educational institutions are frequent in Iraq, as militants attempt to disrupt the country's reconstruction. This attack, however, may have also had sectarian motivations. Mustansiriya University's students are predominantly Shiite, many from the nearby neighborhood of Sadr City. Students report that the University has come under greater influence of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, with some reporting deputies enforcing a strict Islamic dress code and monitoring of students' personal lives. These changes would make the campus a prime target for Sunni militants. The attack also occurred the day after Barzan Ibrahim Hasan and Awad Hamed Bandar, two high-level Sunni officials under Saddam Hussein, were executed for their involvement in the 1982 massacre of 148 Shiite men and boys in Dujail. Attacks were especially violent the day Hussein was executed in late December. It is significant to note that On 4 December 2006 Ansar al-Sunnah issued a video calling on Sunni students and professors to suspend all academic activities at Baghdad universities.
